# Marmoset_headturn_experiment

This set of codes were developed and used in a head turning experiment of marmoset monkeys in 2014.
An MP4 movie and a log file from an exepriment session were proprocessed first, then automatically measured the head direction of each video frame with computer vision algorithms, using openCV library. These processed data could be quickly revised with a revision program.

All the software are under the GNU GPL v3 license.

Developing the software for the exerpiment was supported by ERC Advanced Grant SOMACCA # 230604.
